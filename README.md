# Code for the article called "A data-driven approach to predict urinary incontinence in men with localized prostate cancer"
This repo contains the code required to run the analyses described in the scientific article "A comparison of machine learning models for predicting urinary incontinence in men with localized prostate cancer" by H. Hasannejadasl et al.


in order to run the code, researchers need to run the RMD's in the following order: First, run the data exploration RMD file located in [this repository](https://github.com/riannefijten/codeErectileDysfunctionArticle). This file does all the preprocessing necessary to generate the dataset that is used in further machine learning analyses. Then you can run either the 1 year or 2 year document, which will each generate a model for their respective time point.

The scripts folder contains all the handmade functions that are used in the general RMD's.
